## 🔧 **Key Technical Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Multi-Process Approach**: Coordinator + 4 specialists for security
- **Node.js Build Pipeline**: Replaced Docker with custom Node.js solution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Mock AO environment for isolated testing
- **Development-First**: Mock USDA for immediate development capability

### **Technology Stack Confirmed**
- **Backend**: Lua processes on AO network
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Testing**: Busted framework with custom mocks
- **Build**: Node.js with manual Lua file processing
- **Deployment**: AOForm for multi-process coordination

---

## 🎯 **Next Actions**

### **Phase 1: Complete TIM3 System Deployment (Immediate Priority)**

**🤖 AI Agent Responsibilities (Automated):**
- Navigate to process directories
- Start AOS sessions with proper naming
- Load build files using absolute paths
- Apply JSON compatibility fixes
- Document process IDs and results

**👤 Human Responsibilities (Interactive):**
- Execute AOS Lua testing commands (Send, Inbox)
- Verify process functionality
- Confirm success before moving to next process

---

1. **Deploy Remaining TIM3 Processes to AOS**
   - Deploy Coordinator process to AOS
   - Deploy State Manager process to AOS  
   - Deploy Lock Manager process to AOS
   - Deploy Token Manager process to AOS
   - Record all process IDs for configuration

2. **Configure Inter-Process Communication**
   - Configure Coordinator with all process IDs:
     - Mock-USDA: `u8DzisIMWnrfGa6nlQvf1J79kYkv8uWjDeXZ489UMXQ` ✅
     - State Manager: [TO BE DEPLOYED]
     - Lock Manager: [TO BE DEPLOYED] 
     - Token Manager: [TO BE DEPLOYED]
   - Send configuration messages to each process
   - Test Info requests and basic communication

3. **Full System Integration Testing**
   - Test complete TIM3 mint/burn flow on live AOS
   - Verify USDA locking/unlocking with collateral
   - Test circuit breaker and risk management
   - Validate 1:1 backing ratio maintenance

### **Phase 2: Frontend Development**
- React app with Wander wallet integration
- Connect to live AO processes (not mocks)
- User interface for TIM3 operations

### **Phase 3: Production Launch**
- Replace Mock USDA with real USDA token
- End-to-end testing with real assets
- ArNS domain configuration
- Production monitoring setup

## 🎉 **Major Breakthrough: AOS Testing Success**

**Date**: January 28, 2025

### **What We Achieved**
Successfully deployed and tested Mock-USDA process on live AOS network:

- **Process ID**: `u8DzisIMWnrfGa6nlQvf1J79kYkv8uWjDeXZ489UMXQ`
- **Deployment Method**: AOS CLI with `.load` command
- **Key Fix**: Added `json = require('json')` for AOS compatibility
- **Tests Passed**: Info, Balance, Mint operations all working
- **Result**: 1000 mUSDT successfully minted and tracked

### **Technical Insights**
1. **AOS Environment Differences**: Global `json` object not available by default
2. **File Loading**: Must use full paths when loading from different directories  
3. **Message Passing**: Request/response pattern works perfectly on live network
4. **State Persistence**: Process state maintained correctly across messages

### **Development Workflow Validated**
```bash
# 1. Develop locally
vim src/process.lua

# 2. Build for deployment  
node ../../scripts/build-process.cjs .

# 3. Deploy to AOS
aos process-name
.load /full/path/to/build/process.lua
json = require('json')  # Fix compatibility

# 4. Test functionality
Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Info" })
Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Mint", Amount = "1000" })
```
