## 🔧 **Key Technical Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Multi-Process Approach**: Coordinator + 4 specialists for security
- **Node.js Build Pipeline**: Replaced Docker with custom Node.js solution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Mock AO environment for isolated testing
- **Development-First**: Mock USDA for immediate development capability

### **Technology Stack Confirmed**
- **Backend**: Lua processes on AO network
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Testing**: Busted framework with custom mocks
- **Build**: Node.js with manual Lua file processing
- **Deployment**: AOForm for multi-process coordination

---

## 🎯 **Next Actions**

### **Phase 1: Complete TIM3 System Deployment (Immediate Priority)**

**🤖 AI Agent Responsibilities (Automated):**
- Navigate to process directories
- Start AOS sessions with proper naming
- Load build files using absolute paths
- Apply JSON compatibility fixes
- Document process IDs and results

**👤 Human Responsibilities (Interactive):**
- Execute AOS Lua testing commands (Send, Inbox)
- Verify process functionality
- Confirm success before moving to next process

---

1. **✅ COMPLETED - Deploy All TIM3 Processes to AOS**
   - ✅ Deploy Coordinator process to AOS (`DoXrn6DGZZuDMkyun4rmXh7k8BY8pVxFpr3MnBWYJFw`)
   - ✅ Deploy State Manager process to AOS (`K2FjwiTmncglx0pISNMft5-SngxW-HUjs9sctzmXtU4`)
   - ✅ Deploy Lock Manager process to AOS (`MWxRVsCDoSzQ0MhG4_BWkYs0fhcULB-OO3f2t1RlBAs`)
   - ✅ Deploy Token Manager process to AOS (`BUhWwGfuD1GUHVIIWF_Jhm1mfcyAYHOJS6W90ur2Bb0`)
   - ✅ Record all process IDs for configuration

2. **Configure Inter-Process Communication**
   - Configure Coordinator with all process IDs:

## 🎉 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: ALL 5 TIM3 PROCESSES DEPLOYED TO AOS!**

**Date**: January 27, 2025

### **Historic Achievement: Complete TIM3 System Deployment**
Successfully deployed and tested ALL 5 TIM3 processes on live AOS network:

#### **Process Deployment Results:**
1. **Mock-USDA**: `u8DzisIMWnrfGa6nlQvf1J79kYkv8uWjDeXZ489UMXQ` ✅
2. **TIM3 Coordinator** (Original): `DoXrn6DGZZuDMkyun4rmXh7k8BY8pVxFpr3MnBWYJFw` ✅  
3. **🆕 TIM3 Enhanced Coordinator**: `dxkd6zkK2t5k0fv_-eG3WRTtZaExetLV0410xI6jfsw` ✅ **PRODUCTION**
4. **State Manager**: `K2FjwiTmncglx0pISNMft5-SngxW-HUjs9sctzmXtU4` ✅
5. **Lock Manager**: `MWxRVsCDoSzQ0MhG4_BWkYs0fhcULB-OO3f2t1RlBAs` ✅
6. **Token Manager**: `BUhWwGfuD1GUHVIIWF_Jhm1mfcyAYHOJS6W90ur2Bb0` ✅

### **What We Achieved**
Successfully deployed and tested Mock-USDA process on live AOS network:

- **Process ID**: `u8DzisIMWnrfGa6nlQvf1J79kYkv8uWjDeXZ489UMXQ`
- **Deployment Method**: AOS CLI with `.load` command
- **Key Fix**: Added `json = require('json')` for AOS compatibility
- **Tests Passed**: Info, Balance, Mint operations all working
- **Result**: 1000 mUSDT successfully minted and tracked

### **Technical Insights**
1. **AOS Environment Differences**: Global `json` object not available by default
2. **File Loading**: Must use full paths when loading from different directories  
3. **Message Passing**: Request/response pattern works perfectly on live network
4. **State Persistence**: Process state maintained correctly across messages

### **Development Workflow Validated**
```bash
# 1. Develop locally
vim src/process.lua

# 2. Build for deployment  
node ../../scripts/build-process.cjs .

# 3. Deploy to AOS
aos process-name
.load /full/path/to/build/process.lua
json = require('json')  # Fix compatibility

# 4. Test functionality
Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Info" })
Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Mint", Amount = "1000" })
```
