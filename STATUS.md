## 🛠️ **Development Commands That Work**

### **Build Commands**
```bash
# Build all processes
npm run ao:build

# Build individual processes
npm run mock-usda:build
npm run coordinator:build
npm run lock-manager:build
npm run token-manager:build
npm run state-manager:build
```

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Test all processes
npm run ao:test

# Test individual processes
npm run mock-usda:test
# (others not yet implemented)

# Manual test run
cd ao/mock-usda && busted test/simple_spec.lua
```

### **Development Server**
```bash
# Frontend development
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 **Key Technical Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Multi-Process Approach**: Coordinator + 4 specialists for security
- **Node.js Build Pipeline**: Replaced Docker with custom Node.js solution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Mock AO environment for isolated testing
- **Development-First**: Mock USDA for immediate development capability

### **Technology Stack Confirmed**
- **Backend**: Lua processes on AO network
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Testing**: Busted framework with custom mocks
- **Build**: Node.js with manual Lua file processing
- **Deployment**: AOForm for multi-process coordination

---

## 🎯 **Next Actions**

### **Immediate (Next Session)**
1. **Build TIM3 Coordinator Process**
   - Main entry point for user interactions
   - Orchestrates lock USDA → mint TIM3 flow
   - Communicates with all specialist processes

### **Following Steps**  
2. Build State Manager (collateral ratio tracking)
3. Build Lock Manager (USDA collateral handling)
4. Build Token Manager (TIM3 minting/burning)
5. Integrate all processes with comprehensive testing

### **Future Phases**
- Frontend development with Wander wallet
- End-to-end testing and deployment
- Production launch preparation

## 💡 **Context for New Claude Sessions**

If this conversation ends, a new Claude can continue by:

1. **Reading this STATUS.md** - complete current state
2. **Reading IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md** - detailed progress history  
3. **Reviewing git commits** - see actual work completed
4. **Examining project structure** - understand architecture
5. **Running existing tests** - verify current functionality

### **Key Files to Review**
- `plan/CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md` - Original comprehensive plan
- `apps/tim3/ao/mock-usda/src/process.lua` - Working token example
- `apps/tim3/ao/mock-usda/test/simple_spec.lua` - Testing patterns
- `apps/tim3/package.json` - Working build commands

### **Current Environment**
- MacOS with Homebrew, Lua 5.4, LuaRocks, Busted installed
- Working build and test pipeline
- Git repository with commit history
- All tools functional and tested
