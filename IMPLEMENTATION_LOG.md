# TIM3 Implementation Progress Log

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

### 🏗️ Project Structure (2025-08-26)
- ✅ Created 5-process architecture following ao-starter-kit patterns
- ✅ Set up comprehensive build system with Docker/Lua squishing
- ✅ Configured AOForm for multi-process deployment
- ✅ Added development scripts for testing and building
- ✅ Ready for process implementation

### 📁 Architecture Implemented
```
apps/tim3/
├── ao/coordinator/          # TIM3 main orchestrator
├── ao/lock-manager/         # USDA collateral management  
├── ao/token-manager/        # TIM3 token operations
├── ao/state-manager/        # System state tracking
├── ao/mock-usda/           # Development USDA token
├── scripts/                # Build utilities
├── aoform.yaml            # Deployment configuration
└── package.json           # Complete build pipeline
```

### 🔧 Development Tools Ready
- **Build Commands**: `npm run ao:build` for all processes
- **Testing Framework**: Busted setup for comprehensive testing
- **Individual Testing**: Process-specific test commands
- **Deployment**: `npm run ao:deploy` via AOForm

## 🚧 Phase 2: Process Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

### ✅ Mock USDA Complete (2025-08-26)
- ✅ **Mock USDA**: COMPLETED with comprehensive testing
- 🟡 **TIM3 Coordinator**: Next to implement
- ⭕ **Lock Manager**: Waiting  
- ⭕ **Token Manager**: Waiting
- ⭕ **State Manager**: Waiting

### 🎉 Mock USDA Achievements
- **Full Token Functionality**: Balance, Transfer, Mint operations
- **Collateral System**: Lock/Unlock mechanisms for TIM3 backing
- **Professional Testing**: 8 comprehensive tests passing (8 successes / 0 failures / 0 errors)
- **Security Features**: Input validation, balance checks, locked amount tracking
- **Mock AO Environment**: Complete testing framework with isolated environment
- **Build Pipeline**: Working Node.js-based build system (no Docker dependency)

### 🛠️ Development Environment Complete
- ✅ **Homebrew + Lua**: Professional Lua development tools installed
- ✅ **LuaRocks + Busted**: Testing framework fully operational
- ✅ **Build System**: Custom Node.js build pipeline working
- ✅ **JSON Library**: lua-cjson installed and functional

### Next Implementation Steps
1. ✅ ~~Complete Mock USDA with basic token functionality~~ ✅ DONE
2. **Build TIM3 Coordinator for user interactions** ← NEXT
3. Implement State Manager for collateral tracking  
4. Create Lock Manager for USDA collateralization
5. Build Token Manager for TIM3 minting/burning
