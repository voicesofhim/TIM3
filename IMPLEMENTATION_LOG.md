# TIM3 Implementation Progress Log

## 🎉 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: AOS Live Testing Success** (2025-01-28)

### ✅ Mock-USDA Successfully Deployed to Live AOS Network
- **Achievement**: First successful deployment and testing of TIM3 component on live AOS
- **Process ID**: `u8DzisIMWnrfGa6nlQvf1J79kYkv8uWjDeXZ489UMXQ`
- **Tests Passed**: Info, Balance, Mint operations all working perfectly
- **Result**: 1000 mUSDT successfully minted and tracked on live network

### 🔧 Critical Technical Fixes & Lessons Learned

**🚨 CRITICAL FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:**

1. **JSON Compatibility Issue Resolved**
   - **Problem**: `json` global not available in AOS environment
   - **Solution**: Added `json = require('json')` in AOS session before any operations
   - **Impact**: All JSON serialization now working correctly
   - **⚠️ Must Do**: Always run `json = require('json')` first in any AOS session

2. **File Loading Process Refined**
   - **Problem**: `.load build/process.lua` fails with "file not found"
   - **Solution**: Use full absolute paths: `.load /Users/ryanjames/Documents/CRØSS/W3B/S3ARCH/apps/tim3/ao/mock-usda/build/process.lua`
   - **Alternative**: Start AOS from the correct directory first
   - **⚠️ Must Do**: Always use absolute paths when loading files into AOS

3. **AOS Session Management**
   - **Best Practice**: Use `aos process-name-test` to create named processes
   - **Debugging**: Use `Inbox[#Inbox]` to check latest responses
   - **Process ID**: Always note the generated process ID for future reference
   - **Workflow**: `aos process-name` → `.load /full/path/to/build/process.lua`
   - **Validation**: Process loaded successfully with all handlers

3. **Message Passing Validated**
   - **Request/Response**: Perfect communication flow established
   - **State Management**: Process state persists correctly across messages
   - **Data Format**: JSON responses properly formatted and received

### 📊 Test Results Summary
```
✅ Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Info" })
   → Response: {"ticker":"mUSDT","totalSupply":0,"denomination":6,"name":"mock-usda-test"}

✅ Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Balance" }) 
   → Response: {"locked":"0","balance":"0","available":"0","target":"..."}

✅ Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Mint", Amount = "1000" })
   → Success: Mint-Response received

✅ Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = "Balance" })
   → Response: {"locked":"0","balance":"1000","available":"1000","target":"..."}
```

### 🚀 Development Workflow Proven
The complete dev → test → deploy → validate cycle now works end-to-end:
1. **Local Development**: Edit `src/process.lua`
2. **Build Process**: `node ../../scripts/build-process.cjs .`
3. **Deploy to AOS**: Load with absolute path
4. **Fix Compatibility**: Add `json = require('json')`
5. **Test Functionality**: Send messages and verify responses

### 🎯 Next Phase Ready
With Mock-USDA proven on live AOS, we're ready to deploy the complete TIM3 system:
- Coordinator Process (main orchestrator)
- State Manager (risk monitoring) 
- Lock Manager (collateral handling)
- Token Manager (TIM3 operations)
