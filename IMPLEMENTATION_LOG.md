# TIM3 Implementation Progress Log

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

### 🏗️ Project Structure (2025-08-26)
- ✅ Created 5-process architecture following ao-starter-kit patterns
- ✅ Set up comprehensive build system with Docker/Lua squishing
- ✅ Configured AOForm for multi-process deployment
- ✅ Added development scripts for testing and building
- ✅ Ready for process implementation

### 📁 Architecture Implemented

├── aoform.yaml            # Deployment configuration
└── package.json           # Complete build pipeline
```

### 🔧 Development Tools Ready
- **Build Commands**: `npm run ao:build` for all processes
- **Testing Framework**: Busted setup for comprehensive testing
- **Individual Testing**: Process-specific test commands
- **Deployment**: `npm run ao:deploy` via AOForm

## ✅ Phase 2: Process Implementation (COMPLETED)

### ✅ All AO Processes Complete (2025-08-26)
- ✅ **Mock USDA**: COMPLETED with comprehensive testing (8/8 tests passing)
- ✅ **TIM3 Coordinator**: COMPLETED with advanced security enhancements
- ✅ **Lock Manager**: COMPLETED with collateral management
- ✅ **Token Manager**: COMPLETED with minting/burning operations
- ✅ **State Manager**: COMPLETED with risk monitoring

### 🎯 Security Enhancements Added
- **Circuit Breaker System**: Per-user limits, block limits, cooldown periods
- **Rate Limiting**: Advanced abuse prevention with user history tracking
- **Emergency Pause**: Admin-controlled system pause functionality
- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute limits for pending operations
- **Minimum Amount Alignment**: Reduced from 10 to 1 to prevent dust attacks

### 🎉 Mock USDA Achievements
- **Full Token Functionality**: Balance, Transfer, Mint operations
- **Collateral System**: Lock/Unlock mechanisms for TIM3 backing
- **Professional Testing**: 8 comprehensive tests passing (8 successes / 0 failures / 0 errors)
- **Security Features**: Input validation, balance checks, locked amount tracking
- **Mock AO Environment**: Complete testing framework with isolated environment
- **Build Pipeline**: Working Node.js-based build system (no Docker dependency)

### 🛠️ Development Environment Complete
- ✅ **Homebrew + Lua**: Professional Lua development tools installed
- ✅ **LuaRocks + Busted**: Testing framework fully operational
- ✅ **Build System**: Custom Node.js build pipeline working
- ✅ **JSON Library**: lua-cjson installed and functional

### Next Implementation Steps
1. ✅ ~~Complete Mock USDA with basic token functionality~~ ✅ DONE
2. ✅ ~~Build TIM3 Coordinator for user interactions~~ ✅ DONE
3. ✅ ~~Implement State Manager for collateral tracking~~ ✅ DONE
4. ✅ ~~Create Lock Manager for USDA collateralization~~ ✅ DONE
5. ✅ ~~Build Token Manager for TIM3 minting/burning~~ ✅ DONE
6. **Deploy to AO Network** ← NEXT PRIORITY

## 📋 Upcoming Phases

### Phase 3: AO Network Deployment (NEXT PRIORITY)
- Deploy all 5 AO processes to live network
- Configure process communication with live IDs
- Test live system integration and security features
- Verify 1:1 USDA backing works in production
- End-to-end functionality validation on live network

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
- React app with Wander wallet integration
- Connect to live AO processes (not mocks)
- User interface for USDA → TIM3 operations
- Real-time balance and collateral ratio display

### Phase 5: Production Launch
- Replace Mock USDA with real USDA token
- ArNS domain configuration
- Production monitoring and analytics
- User acceptance testing
